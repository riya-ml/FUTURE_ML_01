# Sales and Demand Forecasting – Task 1

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing historical sales data to understand trends, patterns, and demand fluctuations. The goal is to gain insights that can help in forecasting future sales and improving inventory and supply chain management.

## Objectives
- Analyze historical sales data to identify patterns and trends.
- Understand seasonal demand fluctuations and high-demand periods.
- Visualize key metrics such as total sales per product and category.
- Prepare data for sales forecasting.

## Methodology
1. *Data Collection*: The sales dataset was collected in CSV format containing historical sales records, product information, and timestamps.
2. *Data Cleaning*: Missing values were handled, duplicates were removed, and data types were corrected for accurate analysis.
3. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*:
   - Analyzed total sales per product and category.
   - Examined trends over time using line plots.
   - Identified seasonal patterns and high-demand periods.
   - Checked correlations between different features using heatmaps.
4. *Data Visualization*:
   - Bar plots for product and category sales.
   - Line plots for sales over time.
   - Heatmaps for correlation analysis.
5. *Machine Learning Model*:
   - *Linear Regression* was used to predict future sales based on historical trends and features in the dataset.

## Technologies Used
- *Programming Language*: Python
- *Development Environment*: Jupyter Notebook
- *Libraries*: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Output
- Visualizations showing sales trends over time.
- Bar charts indicating high-performing products and categories.
- Heatmaps showing feature correlations.
- Predicted sales values from the Linear Regression model.
- Insights into seasonal demand and peak sales periods.

## Conclusion
The sales and demand data was successfully analyzed and visualized. The insights obtained highlight trends, seasonal patterns, and high-demand periods, providing a strong foundation for building accurate sales forecasting models in future tasks.
